When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You may want to use a remote repository when you have multiple people collaborating on the same code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes allows you to understand what changes have happened to the master branch since your last push/pull.
