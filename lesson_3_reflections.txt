When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You may want to use a remote repository when you have multiple people collaborating on the same code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes allows you to understand what changes have happened to the master branch since your last push/pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork is a copy of a repository from one GitHub account to another
- Clone is a copy of a repository from your GitHub account to your local computer. You can also make a copy of a local repository to another location on your local computer using clone.
- Branches are also a copy of a repo but it is used within a repository to so that a new feature can be worked on while not affecting the master repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state is it allows you to work offline for a longer period of time while working on add features to the latest code base.
