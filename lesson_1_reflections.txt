How did viewing a diff between two versions help you to spot the bug?

It was helpful because it only showed the differences in the two files and saved time manually scanning through a 1000 lines of code.

Command used:  diff -u game_old.js game_new.js

cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)
pwd # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls  # list the files in this directory

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having access to the history of a file can help you rollback to a previous version if required during troubleshooting.
It can also help you to see what has changed from release to release.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Manual commits allow you to choose a logical separation for your commits. However, the con is that you may forget to commit and leave yourself with too big of a code change.
Auto commiting doesn't give you a logical break between commits and you could end up with too many changes which will be hard to follow when looking at the history of a file.
