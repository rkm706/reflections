What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a new GIT repository which will allow you go commit new code changes.

Use git add to add files to the staging area. The staging area is where files reside prior to being committed.

If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to batch up a small number of files from the working directory. This allows you to commit smaller logical code changes, instead of committing all files everytime there is a small change to the code base.
